In the 'multi_state_code .R', we used the unidirectional multi-state model (MSM) to assess indicators in the temporal disease progression from free of CMDs to FCMD, CMM, and death. 

In the 'calculate PPV and NPV. R', we separated all transition stages to calculate C-statistics with the Cox model, and sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV with the logistic model to calculate separate prediction capabilities at different transition states.
